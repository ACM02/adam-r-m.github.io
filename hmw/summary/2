‘Modal’ phenomena pertain to what is necessary or possible.  On a canonical
analysis, modality is explicated in terms of ‘possible worlds’: necessities
hold (are true) in all of them, possibilities in some; while ‘mere’
possibility is distinguished from factuality by identifying a unique ‘actual
world’, such that what is true in it is exactly what is true ‘full stop’ (we
‘occupy’ it), with any other possible world verifying at least some falsehood.
On this analysis, reasoning about modality involves ‘consideration’ of
possible worlds; but a contrast in \ul{\textbf{modal perspective}} in such
reasoning has been widely recognized since the late 1970s, between considering
a world ‘as counterfactual’ (thinking about it ‘from the outside’) and ‘as
actual’ (‘from the inside’: pretending we occupy it). 

Metaphysics has long invoked the possible-worlds analysis; but (in striking
contrast with epistemology) has made scant use of this contrast in modal
perspective, with a pervasive tropism toward the \ul{consideration of
possibilities as-counterfactual}.  \ul{By contrast, our} proposed research
program \ul{will} demonstrate that appreciation of ‘as-actual’
\ul{consideration generates novel (and systematically unified)} solutions to a
diversity of long-standing metaphysical puzzles. \ul{Headway on this research
program has already been made in our recent collaborative investigations. Our
objective during the granting period will be to round out and extend this
initial research to a full treatment of the metaphysical significance of modal
perspective, through a series of singly- and jointly-authored articles
terminating in a co-authored monograph.} 

The puzzles addressed exhibit a common tension: for \ul{many claims} M of
metaphysics, \ul{certain data supports a \emph{stability} thesis} (M holds, or
else fails to hold, in absolutely all possible worlds) \ul{while certain other
data supports a verdict of \emph{dependence}} (M somehow varies in truth from
world to world \ul{as a function of contingent underlying circumstances}).
With only the as-counterfactual perspective \ul{at our disposal}, the tension
is genuine: if M holds (or else fails) in absolutely all worlds
as-counterfactual, M has (of course) no scope for variation across worlds
as-counterfactual. But invoking the as-actual perspective dissipates any
tension: fixing a world \ul{as-actual}, M holds (or else fails) in absolutely
all worlds as-counterfactual (stability); but varying the as-actual world can
vary which of `hold' or `fail' it is (dependence).

To illustrate: `Chisholm's Paradox' of material artifact
origins poses a long-familiar putative tension in intuitive judgement. A
hammer, H, is built from an iron head and an oak handle. Intuitively: (\ul{M})
building H from a lead head and an elm handle is absolutely (`metaphysically')
impossible; because M concerns what is metaphysically impossible, M is
intuitively invariant from world to world (stability); H built from iron+elm
or lead+oak is possible; and in an iron+elm- or lead+oak-world, by parity of
reason, (not-M) lead+elm is possible: so M does, after all, vary from world to
world (dependence). Solution: the ‘parity of reason’ is under as-actual
\hl{supposition concerning} the origin of H---on which supposition the
(stable) as-counterfactual
possibilities for \hl{H's} origin turn out to depend.

Aspects of the program touch
several subregions of philosophy. (1) A canvas of the scope of further
metaphysical puzzles falling to this strategy, and their detailed analysis:
preliminary work suggests a remarkable breadth, covering, among others,
puzzles in ontology as well as in metaphysics of science. (2) Matters in
philosophy of language including both ‘descriptive semantics’ (the formal
analysis of particular linguistic constructions) and ‘metasemantics’ (the
articulation and interpretation of a framework within which descriptive
semantics is best pursued). (3) Historical investigation, to account for the
surprising neglect of modal perspective in metaphysics, into both the
development of specific subliteratures and more general tendencies in the
analytical tradition.
